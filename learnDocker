The Docker commands we've covered so far are:

docker [-d] [-p host:container] [-v /host/path:/container/path] run <IMAGE NAME>, which runs a Docker image
docker images, which displays all installed images
docker ps [-a], which displays all containers on the system
docker exec <CONTAINER ID> <COMMAND>, which lets you run a command inside a running container
docker stop <CONTAINER ID>, which stops a running container


A Dockerfile is a list of commands, a lot like a shell script, that progressively builds the image:
FROM lists the image to "inherit" from
RUN executes a shell command
COPY copies some data from the host to the image
ENTRYPOINT sets the command that will be run when a container is created
WORKDIR, like cd, sets the current working directory for the build script
